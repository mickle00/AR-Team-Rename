A script to deploy changes & dependencies around renaming GoBig to AR

--Need to manually change the Case.Team__c values from GB - YYY to AR YYYY prior to running this script
--Need to update sf.properties with correct login information, regarding environment, etc
--Need to update run_book.sh with force login -i={env} based upon environment test/login

run run_book.sh to kick off the process

Note, this will do 2 deployments. Could look at combining the outputs into one package.xml and deploying that together
Also, while the system is in an 'inconsistent state' list views may not show all cases
